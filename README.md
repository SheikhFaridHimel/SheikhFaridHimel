Hey, glamours! Me, Sheikh Farid Himel, is my full name. My nickname is Himel. I live in Bangladesh, Dhaka is more precisely and this is my present and permanent location. I have just completed my intermediate education at a government college. Now I am pursuing my BBA(Hons) At National University Bangladesh. I belong to a nuclear family. And habitually I am an introverted person.  Thatâ€™s true now we are living in the digital world so probably it's general that young people to be addicted to video games, Facebooking, YouTubing, programming, and passing time on any type of social media but still I am interested in writing, drawings, reading books, seeing nature, etc. Since we are living in the digital age, so in this case, all of us need to be flexible who are not interested in digitalness. Because generation can't be changed, in fact, generation changes us. So gradually I am getting interested in web designing, Digital marketing, graphic designing, programming, etc.  Today I am busy for build-up myself for the next world.
